		FLAWED UNDERSTANDING OF THE LOGIN PROCCESS

see audit_login.py comments for more accurate representation of the authentification
process. This page was created for my first time run through of trying to log in with
duo and was used mainly as a place to organize my though process. The audit_login.py
was written from scratch after realizing there were errors somewhere in the current
process (found out at the very end...).

		FLAWED UNDERSTANDING OF THE LOGIN PROCCESS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any act.ucsd.edu/ site redirects you to a5.ucsd.edu/tritON/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO?

The first redirect sends you there with the following Query Strings
	- SAMLRequest value: looks like some hash
	- RelayState value: original site you want to visit

This will automatically redirect you again with different Query Strings
	- execution value: e?s1
		- s1: represents the first part of signing on (cred)
		- e?: starts at 1 and racks up with each unsucesful login
Filling in credentials on this page fills a POST form to that url with the data
	- format: 'x-www-form-urlencoded' 
		- urn:mace:ucsd.edu:sso:username: PID
		- urn:mace:ucsd.edu:sso:password: password
		- _eventId_proceed: 
			- not sure what this is but it pops up a lot lol

This will then redirect again with a different Query String
	- execution value: e?s2
		- s2: represents the second part of signing on (duo)
		- e?: is the same e? in prior redirect
	Page holds a duo host and ticket for generating a signon session
		- depends on executing javascript for duo and page will tell u this
		- however, this can be done manually with the following request
	Empty POST to https://api-ce13a1a7.duosecurity.com's /frame/web/v1/auth?
		url with the following Query Strings:
		- tx: data found within e?s2 content
			- thinking it might be a duo 'ticket' hash 
		- parent: e?s2 url encoded (%3A :, %2F /, %3F ?)
			- encoded so as not to be confused with url
	This will redirect you to /frame/prompt url with Query String
		- sid: session ID that's generated from above empty POST

Choosing an authentication method fills a POST form to above given url with data:
	- 'x-www-form-urlencoded' format
		- device: phone1
		- factor: Duo Push
	When this is done, the chosen device will receive a duo push notification
	The contents of the response will also hold a txid used in the next post

The next POST request is sent to /frame/status/? with the Query String
	- sid: saved session ID will go here
	- 'x-www-form-urlencoded' format for POST form contents:
		- txid: found in the contents of prior post
	In the browser, this is sent twice - once to confirm that the txid is 
	valid, and the second time will be waiting until user selects a choice
		- response form this request will wait until timeout or user, 
		with contents holding the appropriate message (fail/success/timeout)

The next POST form request to send goes to /frame/status/<txid>/? with Query String
	- sid: save session ID will go here
	- 'x-www-form-urlencoded' format for POST form contents:
		- txid: saved 'ticket' id goes here
	Response contents holds 'cookie' which will be used in the followin post
	under the name 'sig_response'

The next POST form actually sent to original a5.ucsd.edu/tritON...e?s2 that this
	duo step is supposed to be on, which just takes 2 peices of data
	- 'x-www-form-urlencoded' format for POST form contents:
		-_eventId: proceed
			- again no clue what this is but here it is again lol
		-sig_response: saved from the prior POST response

Well the contents of that POST is supposed to hold the end product SAMLResponse
(long ass hash) as well as the RelayState (original site you wanted to visit) 
The final step would be to send one last POST request to act.ucsd.edu/Shibboleth.sso/SAML2/POST
with those two 

HOLD UP
turns out the content of the /frame/status/<txid>/? post response had parent =
to https://a5.ucsd.edu/tritON/...e?s2= BUT you're sending the next post to =e?s2
IT WAS JUST THE '=' BEING IN THE WRONG PLACE
B R U H

Anyways, once you send the POST form to a5.ucsd.edu/tritON...=e?s2 with the data
		-_eventId: proceed
		-sig_response: saved from earlier POST reponse
You'll receive another page telling you it was javascript dependant and contains
	The RelayState and url to submit the post form but they are both encoded
		Using &#x<hex>; for :,/,and= characters
	An SAMLResponse is also listed in the contents, however the size of it
	is about half of how long it should be, maybe it's encoded or something?
		I mean it ends in '==' so maybe double base 64 encoding?

OH ok it looks like the SAMLResponse is a base64 encoding of how succesful 
authentication was and it looks like this whole process wasn't very successful...
Some lines from the decoded bit read:
<saml2p:StatusCode Value="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:AuthnFailed"/>
</saml2p:StatusCode><saml2p:StatusMessage>An error occurred.</saml2p:StatusMessage>

Wow, so there were a bunch of mistakes - mostly some cookies not being saved and
me resorting to workarounds to get to the pages I wanted instead of fixing the 
issues with cookies. (issues seemed to arise from having incorrect request headers
- manually setting them in the new audit_login.py file ended up giving the cookies
needed).

The new file follows the process that browsers go through almost exactly, whereas 
this process deviates a lot around the part where the POST to duo's prompt and 
status are sent.
